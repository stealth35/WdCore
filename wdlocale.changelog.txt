2010-02-25 # 1.0

[NEW] i18n path are stored in a _pending_ array and messages are only read on the first translation
of a string using the translate() method.

This brings multiple welcoming effects :

* Until the first translation occurs, one can change the language of the system. For example, the
`user.users` module can now switch the system language to the users's language. This was not
possible earlier because catalogs where loaded by the WdCore class as modules were read.

* The messages loading process might get skiped completely if no string translation occurs, which
happens quite frequently during operations.

* The cache has a wider scope. Not only module catalogs are cached, but any catalog available in
the path added using the addPath() method, before the first translation occurs.  

[CHG] All the methods of the WdLocale class are now static.

[CHG] The localize() method has been renamed as translate().

[DEL] Removed the translate() method.

[DEL] Removed the addCatalog() method.

[CHG] Overhaul of the i18n system.

Language codes use Linux (?) codes : http://www.debian.org/international/l10n/po/fr_FR, with
multiple fallbacks. Four catalogs might be read to complete a catalog. e.g. for the fr_FR code:

	fr_FR + fr + en_US + en
	
Missing strings are added from the left to the righ.
