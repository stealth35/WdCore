2010-02-25 # 0.2 - WIP

[DEL] The `require` feature has been remove because, considering the autoload feature of WdCore, it
was making little sense.

[DEL] The `namespace` feature was removed to because callback definition was not clear, and
defining _classic_ callback is not such a hard job, giving that they don't change very often.

[CHG] The 'callback' and 'params' keys are now numeric keys (0 and 1). Named keys are only used
for options. Callback definitions look cleaner :

	$definition = array
	(
		array('callback'), array
		(
			'param1' => array(),
			'param2' => array()
		)
	)

[CHG] The 'list' key, used to provide a list of hooks for a defined namespace, is now a numeric
key with the value 0.




2009-12-11 # 0.1.2

In order to avoid the `params` property to be overriden by subsequent calls, the Hook object is now
cloned before its callback is called.
