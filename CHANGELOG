[NEW] WdModel: The active record class is now inherited from the parent model.

[NEW] WdModule: Added getters support.

[NEW] WdModule: Added 'model' getter.

[NEW] WdHook: Callback can now be objects defined as 'o:<object_class>'.

[NEW] The path to the config origin is now used as a key for each configs.

[NEW] The autoloader now executes the `__static_construct()` method where available. This feature
should be used to replace the former autoconfig process.

[NEW] WdActiveRecord: One can implement the `__get_them_all` method to create a general fallback
for the `__get` method.

[NEW] Added RESTful support for operations.

[NEW] Operations can now be defined using routes.

[NEW] Added the WdApplicationSession class for lazy session creation using the `session` virtual
property of the application object. The session is now started on demand.

[NEW] Models can now be directly loaded using the core object. 

[CHG] WdHook: Hook's callback is not longer called with a clone of the hook as first parameter.
The arguments passed to the call() method are passed as is to the hook's callback.

[CHG] The WdOperation::dispatch() method now returns the result of the operation.

[CHG] The classes autoconfig() method now receive an array of configs instead of a variable number

[NEW] The WdHook class has been completely rewrote.

[NEW] WdImage: Unless the user provided a callback, the background of resized images is now filled
with a transparent color, preserving the transparency of resized images.

[NEW] The WdCore::getConstructedConfig() static method can be used to get a constructed config. If
the constructed config doesn't exists yet, the provided constructor is called with all the pending
configs. The resulting constructed config is then returned. The constructed config is stored if
'cache configs' is set to true in the `core` config.

For most classes, this system might be a better solution then the `autoconfig` one.  

[NEW] WdFileCache: When available, APC is used to cache data.

[CHG] WdFileCache: The order of the arguments for the constructor of the load() method have changed
form 'cache, file, userdata' to 'userdata, cache, file'.

the exception is stringified.

table would be `node` and the alias for a `categories` table would be `category`.

[NEW] WdOperation: The `method` property can now be used to known which method was used for the 
operation (GET / POST). The `terminus` property is set to TRUE for GET method operations.
