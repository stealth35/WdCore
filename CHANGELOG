[NEW] The WdHook class has been completely rewrote.

[NEW] WdImage: Unless the user provided a callback, the background of resized images is now filled
with a transparent color, preserving the transparency of resized images.

[NEW] The WdCore::getConstructedConfig() static method can be used to get a constructed config. If
the constructed config doesn't exists yet, the provided constructor is called with all the pending
configs. The resulting constructed config is then returned. The constructed config is stored if
'cache configs' is set to true in the `core` config.

For most classes, this system might be a better solution then the `autoconfig` one.  

[NEW] WdFileCache: When available, APC is used to cache data.

[CHG] WdFileCache: The order of the arguments for the constructor of the load() method have changed
form 'cache, file, userdata' to 'userdata, cache, file'. 

[FIX] WdException: The HTTP code is no longer set in the header during the __construct but when the
the exception is stringified.

[NEW] WdDatabaseTable: Smart aliases are now used during SQL queries. Instead of the puzzling `t1`
or `t2`, the aliases are now created using the table's name. e.g. the alias for the `system_nodes`
table would be `node` and the alias for a `categories` table would be `category`.

[NEW] WdOperation: The `method` property can now be used to known which method was used for the 
operation (GET / POST). The `terminus` property is set to TRUE for GET method operations.
