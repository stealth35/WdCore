[NEW] WdDatabaseTable: Smart aliases are now used during SQL queries. Instead of the puzzling `t1`,
`t2` etc. the aliases are now created using the table's name. e.g. the alias for the `system_nodes`
table is now `node`, the alias for a `categories` table would be `category`.

[NEW] WdOperation: The `method` property can now be used to known which method was used for the 
operation (GET / POST). The `terminus` property is set to TRUE for GET method operations.
