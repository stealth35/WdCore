2010-03-08 # 2.6

[DEL] The `!do` identifier is no longer used for encoded operations. If the '=' character is found
at the end of the `do` identifier, the `do` value is considered encoded.




2010-02-24 # 2.4

[CHG] The `decode()` static method now handles both type of operations (GET & POST), and returns
a WdOperation object.

[CHG] The '<destination>.<operation>:before' event is not longer trigerred, instead a more general
'operation.<operation>:before' event is triggered. 

[DEL] Because the `decode()` method now creates the `WdOperation` object, the `newFormRequest()`
method is deprecated.
 



2010-01-18 # 2.2

[NEW] The `handleBooleans()` method can be used to handle those nasty booleans. You provide the
name of the booleans to handle. The boolean are unioned to the parameters of the operation are
_false_ values. The `filter_var()` method is then used to obtain _real_ booleans.




2009-12-05 # 2.0

This new version introduces a new way of responsing to operations. Because passing the response as
an array was not really practical, event so given that `location` and `terminus` had nothing to
do with the response itself.

This new version of the WdOperation object deprecate the RESPONSE_LOCATION and RESPONSE_TERMINUS
constants and replaces them with the `location` and `terminus` properties. The RESPONSE_RC const is
also deprecated because it's no longer needed as the value returned by the function handling the
operation is the result of the operation. If one needs additionnal informations to be returned
along the result of the operation, he can set them in the `response` property of the WdOperation
object.

[NEW] The getResult() static method replaces the WdModule::getOperationResult().

[NEW] The WdOperation::KEY is to replace WdModule::OPERATION_KEY. A 'key' property is now available
in the object.

[CHG] The `RESPONSE_LOCATION` const is now deprecated and is no longer part of the response. The
`location` property of the WdOperation object can be used to achieve the same effect.

[CHG] The `RESPONSE_TERMINUS` const is now deprecated and is no longer part of the response. The
`terminus` property of the WdOperation object can be used to achieve the same effect.
